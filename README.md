# STM32F4 Projects
This is a simple repo of various different projects working with the STM32F4 discovery board.

## Project Layout
- 'docs' : pdfs/documentation/ref docs
- 'mu' : any files related to booting up the STM32F4, linker script, startup code, vector table, etc
- 'src' : implementation of the microcontroller features
- 'device' : src code for any external IC, L293D, etc...
- 'projects' : different projects for the STM32F4 that are self-contained
- 'Ancient' : old projects no longer maintained, but still a usefull reference.
  - 'devices': contains any code related to particular devices or IC
  - 'include' : the necessary .h file and autogenerated file from STMCUBE
  - 'source'   : implementation of the header files
  - 'system'   : any file related to linker/startup/etc.
  - 'projects' : different projects for the STM32F4

## Types of Projects
There are three types of projects
1. Ancient Projects
2. Bare Metal Projects

### Ancient Projects
Ancient Projects are projects that all share common code and use the auto
generated file from ST STM32 Cube application. I no longer base future projects
on these since I prefer bare metal projects. All Ancient Projects and related
files will be house in the [Ancient](Ancient) folder.

#### Current list of Ancient Projects
- [CS43L22](Ancient/projects/CS34L22) : onboard CS43L22 to send audio to headphone jack
- [LED Blinking](Ancient/projects/blinky) : simple led blinking program to get started
- [LED via Interrupt](Ancient/projects/blinky_interrupt) : simple led blinking using interrupts.
- [PWM Motor Control](Ancient/projects/motor_pwm) : simple driver for L6205N Full Bridge Driver for Motors
- [Accelerometer](Ancient/projects/spi) : reading STM32F4-discovery onboard accelerometer
- [Temerature Readout](Ancient/projects/temp_lcd) : reading from temperature sensor via ADC and output to character LCD

### Bare Metal Projects
These types of projects uses the homegrown bare metal related files as a base of each project([Mainly the mu folder](mu)).
Common code in the main directory will use common code.

Couple of projects in the [projects folder](projects) are self contain that use bare metal files for learning purposes but rest of projects
share common code.

If you need a self contained project, just copy the [Bare_Metal](projects/bare_metal) folder and rename it. Edit the makefile to tap into common code or copy it over to the bare metal folder if needed.

If you want to use common code then just copy the [Servo](projects/servo) and have fun.

#### Current list of Bare Metal Projects
- [Bare Metal](projects/bare_metal) : create startup, linker script, makefile using bare essential from scratch, self contained
- [RTOS](projects/rtos) : simple operating system as a self learning tool, self contained
- [Servo](projects/servo) : using TIM4 to create a 50hz pwm signal to control a simple servo on PD15. Small tweaks can use to control onboard brightness LED.
