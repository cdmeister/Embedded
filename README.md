# STM32F4 Projects
This is a simple repo of various different projects working with the STM32F4 discovery board.

## Project Layout
- 'docs' : pdfs/documentation/ref docs
- 'projects' : different projects for the STM32F4 that are self-contained
- 'Ancient' : old projects no longer maintained, but still a usefull reference.
  - 'devices': contains any code related to particular devices or IC
  - 'include' : the necessary .h file and autogenerated file from STMCUBE
  - 'source'   : implementation of the header files
  - 'system'   : any file related to linker/startup/etc.
  - 'projects' : different projects for the STM32F4

## Types of Projects
There are three types of projects
1. Ancient Projects
2. Bare Metal Projects

### Ancient Projects
Ancient Projects are projects that all share common code and use the auto
generated file from ST STM32 Cube application. I no longer base future projects
on these since I prefer bare metal projects. All Ancient Projects and related
files will be house in the [Ancient](Ancient) folder.

#### Current list of Ancient Projects
- [CS43L22](Ancient/projects/CS34L22) : onboard CS43L22 to send audio to headphone jack
- [LED Blinking](Ancient/projects/blinky) : simple led blinking program to get started
- [LED via Interrupt](Ancient/projects/blinky_interrupt) : simple led blinking using interrupts.
- [PWM Motor Control](Ancient/projects/motor_pwm) : simple driver for L6205N Full Bridge Driver for Motors
- [Accelerometer](Ancient/projects/spi) : reading STM32F4-discovery onboard accelerometer
- [Temerature Readout](Ancient/projects/temp_lcd) : reading from temperature sensor via ADC and output to character LCD

### Bare Metal Projects
These types of projects uses the homegrown bare metal related files as a base
of each project. All Bare Metal projects are self contain. Meaning, all files that
are needed are within the folder. Every new project will just copy the [Bare_Metal](projects/bare_metal) folder and rename it.

#### Current list of Bare Metal Projects
- [Bare Metal](projects/bare_metal) : create startup, linker script, makefile using bare essential from scratch
- [RTOS](projects/rtos) : simple operating system as a self learning tool
